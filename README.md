# Moomin headers for NGINX

Inspired by [this cool tweet](https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1278274012754309120).

Usage:

```
# in your NGINX conf file (either in a http, server, or location block, depending on what requests you want to enrich with moomin goodness)
include /path/to/moomin.conf;
```
